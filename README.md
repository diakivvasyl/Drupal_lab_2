## Setup environment

1. If you don't know anything about docker4drupal, see, please,
[Mount my codebase](https://wodby.com/docs/stacks/drupal/local/#mount-my-codebase) usage.
Another way run **docker-compose up -d**.
2. After deployment you should enable *My Homework module* and go to /myhmmodulepath
to see how it works.
